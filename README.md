# PROJECT OVERVIEW
**Unravelling the Challenges of Healthcare Accessibility in Africa: A Case Study Primary Goal**
This case study aims to analyze healthcare facility data, identify disparities in access to healthcare between rural and urban regions, and evaluate the efficiency of healthcare funding. The objective is to propose data-driven recommendations that governments and stakeholders can implement to enhance healthcare service delivery across Africa.

# Data Overview  
1. Rural vs. Urban Healthcare Disparities: This dataset provides insights into the distribution of healthcare facilities, the number of doctors and nurses, and patient accessibility across different regions. 
2. Healthcare Workforce Availability: This dataset includes information on the availability of doctors and nurses per facility and how this varies between urban and rural locations. 
3. Patient Accessibility and Utilization: The dataset tracks annual patient visits, average distance to facilities, and emergency response times, helping assess accessibility in different regions. 
4. Funding and Resource Allocation: This dataset explores the funding received by healthcare facilities and their access to essential services like electricity and the internet. 
5. Patient Satisfaction and Healthcare Outcomes: Patient satisfaction rates serve as indicators of service quality, while other factors like emergency response times help evaluate healthcare system efficiency. 

**Key Business Questions**
1. How does the distribution of healthcare facilities compare between rural and urban regions? 
2. Are urban healthcare facilities receiving more funding than rural ones? 
3. Are healthcare facilities with higher funding more likely to have shorter emergency response times? 
4. Which facility types (hospitals, clinics, health centers) show the highest efficiency in terms of funding per patient visit? 
Actionable Insights for Stakeholders 
5. What are the critical factors preventing equal access to healthcare across different regions? 
6. Which policy recommendations can be made to bridge the gap between urban and rural healthcare services? 
7. How can governments optimize healthcare funding allocation to maximize impact in underserved regions? 

**Expected Outcomes**
1. Identify key disparities in healthcare access between rural and urban regions. 
2. Analyze the efficiency of healthcare funding and resource allocation across different facilities. 
3. Provide data-driven insights to improve emergency response times and patient satisfaction. 
4. Develop strategic recommendations for policymakers to ensure equitable healthcare access. 
5. Use data visualization techniques to communicate your findings effectively to stakeholders.

# Classifying Areas into Rural and Urban Areas
Now, to explore the dataset and draw a conclusive analysis, we need to add a new column called Area Type, which we would separate based on Internet Availability, Electricity, Population Size and Average Distance to Facility (km)
